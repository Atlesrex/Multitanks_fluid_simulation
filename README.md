# Multitanks_fluid_simulation
Fluid simulation for Digital Twin, (Fluid part)

Blender and UE4 simulation for fluid simulation.

Here there are two repository:
- Blender simulation / animation (April-May 2020)
- The Multitanks on its good size with square pipe + 3D objects for any future changes (May-June 2020)
- The Multitanks 20x bigger with the good cylindrical pipes + 3D objects for any future changes (July 2020)

The pump is realized by using the gravity settings. So, there is a reservoir above the system.
The valves are modelized by plane object.

In each UE4 level there are:
  - The system (tanks, pipes, frame and reservoirs)
  - Valves as plane object
  - Emitter for fluid (FleX Container, FleX Fluid Surface, Particle system)
  - Different Mater used
  - Level sequence to animate the simulation
