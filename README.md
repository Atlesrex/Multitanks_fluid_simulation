# Multitanks_fluid_simulation
Fluid simulation for Digital Twin, (Fluid part)

UE4 settings for fluid simulation.

Here there are two repository: 
- The Multitanks on its good size with square pipe 
- The Multitanks 20x bigger with the good cylindrical pipes 

The pump is realized by using the gravity settings. So, there is a reservoir above the system.
The valves are modelized by plane object.

In each level there are:
  - The system (tanks, pipes, frame and reservoirs)
  - Valves as plane object
  - Emitter for fluid (FleX Container, FleX Fluid Surface, Particle system)
  - Different Mater used
  - Level sequence to animate the simulation
